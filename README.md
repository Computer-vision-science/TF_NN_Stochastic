Ð The repository has redesigned code taking into account Python and TensorFlow updates. 
Partially used resources:
https://leemeng.tw/using-tensorflow-to-train-a-shallow-nn-with-stochastic-gradient-descent.html
https://github.com/hankcs/udacity-deep-learning/blob/master/1_notmnist.py
but the code there doesn't work on new builds.

The code is guaranteed to work with this build:
Python 3.11.5
conda 24.3.0
numpy 1.23.5
six 1.16.0
tqdm 4.66.5
tensorflow 2.12.0

If you have any questions, ask problems.
